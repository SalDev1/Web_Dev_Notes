Internet builds a network infrastructure that allows
people to connect with other from one place to another.

The world wide web is an information system where 
documents and others resources are available over 
the internet.

Documents are transferred via HTTP.

HTTP --> HyperText Transfer Protocol.
It allows to access any page that has been registered under 
the HTTP protocol + Foundtion of communication on the 
World Wide Web.

It has a mechanism of Sending REQUEST / Accepting RESPONSES
Eg :- 
Request --> I would like this information please.
Response --> Ok , here you go !

How it works :- 
You want to visit a webpage , maybe Youtube , you type in the url and 
when you hit enter , it sends a request to the server as your are on the client side 
then the server sees it, understands it and grants your request and the sever sends 
a response back to the client and response contains all the web content relevant 
to that webpage.

What is Frontend and Backend ??

Frontend --> Deals with Client Side.
Backend --> Deals with Server Side.

Can be easily understood by taking a restaurant example :-
Customers --> Frontend.
Waiters --> HTML Protocol / API (Taking requests and giving responses).
Cookers --> Backend.

There is almost 3 tools the webpage is constructed with , those are
HTML , CSS , Javascript.

What does HTML , CSS and Javascript Do ??

Let's undestand this with an simple example :
The PURPLE DINO DANCED
PURPLE --> CSS (Adjective)
DINO --> HTML (Nouns)
DANCED --> JS (Verbs)

To understand why do we need HTML , CSS ,JAVASCRIPT
Understand the below example :- 

HTML --> What is the entity all about ?
CSS --> How do we describe the entity ?
JAVASCRIPT --> What kind of actions does the entity do ?
