Internet builds a network infrastructure that allows
people to connect with other from one place to another.

The world wide web is an information system where 
documents and others resources are available over 
the internet.

Documents are transferred via HTTP.

HTTP --> HyperText Transfer Protocol.
It allows to access any page that has been registered under 
the HTTP protocol + Foundation of communication on the 
World Wide Web.

It has a mechanism of Sending REQUEST / Accepting RESPONSES
Eg :- 
Request --> I would like this information please.
Response --> Ok , here you go !

How it works :- 
You want to visit a webpage , maybe Youtube , you type in the url and 
when you hit enter , it sends a request to the server as your are on the client side 
then the server sees it, understands it and grants your request and the sever sends 
a response back to the client and response contains all the web content relevant 
to that webpage.

What is Frontend and Backend ??

Frontend --> Deals with Client Side.
Backend --> Deals with Server Side.

Can be easily understood by taking a restaurant example :-
Customers --> Frontend.
Waiters --> HTML Protocol / API (Taking requests and giving responses).
Cookers --> Backend.

There is almost 3 tools the webpage is constructed with , those are
HTML , CSS , Javascript.

What does HTML , CSS and Javascript Do ??

Let's undestand this with an simple example :
The PURPLE DINO DANCED
PURPLE --> CSS (Adjective)
DINO --> HTML (Nouns)
DANCED --> JS (Verbs)

To understand why do we need HTML , CSS ,JAVASCRIPT
Understand the below example :- 

HTML --> What is the entity all about ?
CSS --> How do we describe the entity ?
JAVASCRIPT --> What kind of actions does the entity do ?

W3Schools , MDN --> Other Important Resources for Web


What is HTML 5 ??
It represents two different concepts :- 
1] It is a newer version of the language HTML , with new elements
, attributes and behaviours.
2] It also refers to large set of technologies that allows building
of more diverse and powerful web sites and applications.

HTML5 does help us create a version of the document that supported by different 
browsers.

Inline Elements Vs Block Elements.

Inline Elements fit in alongside other elements. --> (Span Tag).
Block Level Elements take up a whole "block" of space / wants to have it's own block. --> (Div tag)

Span Tag :- helps you to access , modify the specific content / piece of text within elements of HTML 
based on your needs.

<hr> --> This helps you to draw a horizontal line in HTML document.
<br> --> This tag helps us create a separate line between different 
text elements within HTML document.
<sup> , <sub> --> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as 
superscript for solely typographical reasons. 

Semantic Markup :- 
Semantic --> relating to meaning.
"What purpose or role does that HTML element have ?" --> This is meaning of Semantic.

<header> , <footer> all behave like div's but they act and have specific meaning.

Instead of Divs , we can use tags like :- 
<section>
<article>
<nav>
<main>
<header>
<footer>
<aside>
<summary>
<details>

Header --> It includes the introductory content.
Footer --> It is the last part of every web page / similar content to header.

Emmet is a tool that helps us write HTML Code , embeded syntax where 
when you just type in the keyword , the entire HTML code relevant to the keyword 
is shown to HTML Document.

Always hit TAB when you finish writing the Emmet Syntax
Just look at the documentation.
