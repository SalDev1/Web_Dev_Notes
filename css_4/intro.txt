Let's learn about the property name : position .

It's describes how the element should be positioned in the 
document.

top , right , bottom , left --> determine the final location of 
positioned elements.

Static --> keeps things static 
Relative --> putting the element wherever we want
+ destroying the normal flow of the document + more
like not following the normal rules of the website. 

Absolute :- Element is removed from the normal 
document flow and no space is created for the
element in the page layout.
**We can place it freely closed to its closest position 
ancestor / parent container that has relative as its position**.

Fixed : If something / some element is fixed , it is going to stay up 
there. It is positioned relative to the initial containing 
block established.
It is useful for navbar.

Refer the MDN docs to know more about the 
transition effects.

CSS Transform plays a big role in creating transition effect.

Knowing how to use the background image in the background 
is very important.
