       Border

This is how Chrome tools show different attributes of the 
certain element when you insept it.

We know about the width and height of each element.

Border :
We can do many things with border and eventually you get to know 
the properties 

Padding :- 
Real Life Example :
When you are shipping something that is fragile , you have the actual
content , then you have your box border and in between the two ,there is some
padding where it is bubble wrap or styrofoam or bubble wrap.

Padding lies between the content box and border.

Padding Shorthand property.

Apply to all four sides.
padding : 10px;

Apply vertical + horizontal
padding : 5px 10px 

Apply top , horizon , bottom
padding : 1px 2px 2px;

Apply top , right, bottom , left
padding : 5px 1px 0 2px;

Margin :- 
It is the space considered outside of the border between the element 
and something else.

Display :- 
Three types of display.
Inline :- Width and height are ignored. Margin and padding push elements away horizontally but not
vertically.
Block :- Block elements break the flow of a document. Width, Height , Margin and Padding 
are respected.
Inline-Block :- Behaved like an inline element except Width,Height,Margin and Padding are 
respected.

CSS Units Relatively Used :- 
1] EM 
2] REM 
3] VH
4] VM
5] %

% --> 
width -> 50% --> half the width of the parent.
line-height -> 50% --> half the font-size 
of the element itself.

Em --> Relative Units 
1em --> equals the font-size of the parent. 
2em --> twice the font size of the parent.

Rems --> Relative to the root html element's font size.
Often easier to work with. 

If the root font-size is 20px , 
1rem is always 20px;
2rem is always 40px;
