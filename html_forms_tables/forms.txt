What are FORMS ??

<form> element is itself a virtual container that 
doesn't have any visual impact.

We then fill the form with a collection of inputs ,
checkboxes , buttons , etc.

<input> 
1] The input element is used to create a variety of different
form controls.
2] We have 20+ possible types of inputs , ranging from data 
pickers to checkboxes.
3] The type attributes is where the magicx happens.  Changinng type 
dramatically alters the input's behaviour and appearance.

<label> --> represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

Connection between the label and input is define by two attributes 
id(input) and for(label)
