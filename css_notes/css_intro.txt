CSS --> How we do describe the entity , it helps us add attractive / visual 
features on the entity.

CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - 
how they are arranged and styled.

CSS Rules :- 
(almost) everything you do in CSS 
follows this basic pattern.

selector {
    property : value;
}

Eg :- Make all h1 elements purple
h1 {
    color : purple,
}

img {
    width : 100px;
    height : 200px;
}

Select every other text input and give it a red border : 
input[type="text"] : nth-of-type(2n) {
    border : 2px solid red.
}

There are so many CSS Border properties , Don't Worry.
Just go through MDN docs and don't worry about anything.

How do we include styles ?? 
1] You can write your styles directly inline on each element , 
but this is NOT GOOD IDEA most of the time.
2] You can write your styles inside of a <style> element.
This is easy , but it ameks it impossible to share styles 
between documents. Not recommended either.
3] Write your styles in a .css file , and then include using
a <link> in the head of your html document. (Recommended).

Whenever there is a CSS file , always connect it with your HTML file
using the link tool / make sure you connect it with proper path.

HTML Color Picker :- https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/  (For reference)

RGB --> It's how we can form different combinations of the color.
(RED,GREEN,BLUE).
While defining a color in CSS , either use rgb() or hexadecimal number 
to get the RGB color.

HEX --> Still red , green and blue channels.
Each range from 0 - 255 BUT represented with hexadecimal.

#ffff00 --> Blue range  

Semi Colon is important when defining a property with the selector in the 
css file.

px --> by far the most commonly used absolute unit.
1px does not necessarily equal the width of exactly one pixel !.
Not recommended for responsive websites.
