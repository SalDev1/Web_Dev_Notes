<!-- 
    Let's understand more about the HTML boilerplate.

    HTML Skelection or Boilerplate
    We write our HTML in a standard skeleton.

    Type in html5 keyword and you are given a premade
    skeletion that is used to write the HTML content 
    according to our needs.

    title tag -> represents the title of the html document / web page
    It looks for that element in the head and it uses to create 
    links in the search results.

    Whatever html page we are designing , the skeleton has to be 
    used as it is considered as the html template to show the things
    that we want to + it is considered as VALID HTML.
