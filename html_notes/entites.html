<!-- 
    HTML Entites :- 
    1] Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon.
    2] Used to display reserved characters , that normally would be valid.
    3] Also used in place to difficult to type characters.
    4] The browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.

    So conclusion of making use of the entities is to make use of the special reserved 
    characters in the HTML document + the browser understand those symbols by the entity code
    assigned to them.
