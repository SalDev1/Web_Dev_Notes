WHAT IS HTML ??

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

If you want to highlight specific content that has some meaning to it or attaching 
some interactive content such as links , images , etc.
HTML will do that for you.

To write HTML , we pcik from a set of standard elements that all browsers recognize
Common Elements include :- 
<p> element --> represents a paragraph of text.
<h1> lement --> represents the main header on a page.
<img> element --> embeds an image.
<form> element --> represents a form.

We create elements by writing tags.
Most elements consist of an opening and closing tag.

<p> --> Opening Tag.
</p> --> Closing Tag.

<p>I am a paragraph</p>
